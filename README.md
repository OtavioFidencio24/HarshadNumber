# Harshad Number Checker

This is a simple Java program that checks whether a user-provided number is a Harshad Number. A Harshad Number (or Niven Number) is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a number.
2. It calculates the sum of the digits of the entered number.
3. It checks if the number is divisible by the sum of its digits.
4. If divisible, the number is a Harshad Number; otherwise, it is not.
5. The process repeats until the user enters a non-positive number, which ends the program.

## Features

- User input is handled dynamically, allowing for multiple checks in one execution.
- Provides immediate feedback on whether the number is a Harshad Number.
- Simple and interactive console-based interface.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
